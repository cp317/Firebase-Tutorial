Download the repository, then open createbeacon.html in your browser. It will ask you for data, and once you finish entering it the beacon will be stored in our database. 

Then open viewbeacon.html in your browser, and it will show you all the beacons that are stored in our database, including the one you just created.

To understand how those pages work, please read through createbeacon.js and viewbeacon.js. In those two files you can see how I sent and retrieved data from our database. You can ignore the firebase.js file, that is used to setup the database connection.
